Sep 2nd, 10:41 am - $SYF this moves like a snail in the morning and moves like a turtle at noon then becomes a rabbit at the afternoon.
Sep 2nd, 10:27 am - $SYF as far as I can tell their retail card business is stable despite having a rather concentrated customer base. Recession is biggest risk
Sep 2nd, 8:51 am - $SYF Underwriters have exercised their Green Shoe option...which likely means increased float. GE now owns 84.6%.
Aug 30th, 1:43 pm - $SYF How long before this stock is higher than GE. Think I'll have to take the swap.
Aug 29th, 6:12 pm - $SYF in since first day. Prob going all in on Monday.
Aug 29th, 1:04 pm - $SYF long weekend. I have to park my cash into this boringly moving stock. Low risk. If peace prevails in 3 days this one's going higher!

Aug 27th, 8:46 am - $SYF 25 is the new 23
Aug 26th, 2:21 pm - $SYF You can't really "compare" both but look at GE metrics relative to SYF. SYF made money in the crisis. Then tell me this is worth ~25$
Aug 26th, 2:02 pm - $SYF one thing to remember is that the market is "stupid" and could keep this contained.
Aug 26th, 1:58 pm - $SYF main risk is increased cost of capital for SYF..could be a huge risk here and greatly erode earnings.
Aug 26th, 1:56 pm - Comparing $SYF to $DFS based on various ratios such as op & net margin, ROA, ROE, ev/ebitda & EPS this should be ~$35. I will add here.
Aug 26th, 11:06 am - $SYF new magnet level...$25
Aug 26th, 9:01 am - $SYF *U.S. AUG. CONSUMER CONFIDENCE RISES TO 92.4 VS 90.3
Aug 25th, 6:15 pm - $SYF I will look to add on market weakness.
Aug 25th, 6:08 pm - $SYF I am inclined to increase my bet by rolling my  oct $25 calls to mar $30 calls for more leverage.
Aug 25th, 6:04 pm - $SYF The main risk I see here is downturn in consumer spending and concentration risk (95% of retail card rev from 19 retail partners)
Aug 25th, 6:02 pm - $SYF Having done my due diligence on this, I am at loss as to why this is still in the 23-26 ipo range.
Aug 25th, 11:55 am - $SYF Liking this one for further upside to 27.5-28
Aug 25th, 11:11 am - $SYF Market got nervous about S&P hitting that 2000 mark! IMO
